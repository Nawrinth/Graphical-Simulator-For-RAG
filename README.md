# Graphical Simulator for Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)

A Python-based graphical simulator to visualize Resource Allocation Graphs (RAG) and analyze deadlock scenarios. This tool provides an intuitive GUI using Tkinter to model the interaction between processes and resources.

## üß† Features

- Create and visualize Resource Allocation Graphs.
- Add and remove Processes and Resources.
- Create Request and Assignment edges.
- Detect deadlocks via graph cycle detection.
- Interactive GUI with visual feedback.
- Reset and rebuild the graph easily.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- NetworkX (optional, for graph operations)
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Processes (P1, P2, ‚Ä¶)** and **Resources (R1, R2, ‚Ä¶)** are represented as nodes.
- Request Edges (P ‚Üí R) indicate that a process is requesting a resource.
- Assignment Edges (R ‚Üí P) indicate that a resource is assigned to a process.
- The simulator checks for cycles in the graph to detect deadlocks.

## üß™ Example Scenario

1. Add Process `P1` and Resource `R1`.
2. Create a request edge from `P1` to `R1`.
3. Assign `R1` to `P2` instead.
4. If `P2` also requests `R1`, a deadlock is detected.
